# Reasons to choose PFE stock
Since the COVID-19 pandemic broke out worldwide, with the current increase in coronavirus concerns among investors, stockpiles or vaccine companies could be the choice worth considering in today's stock market. 
After all, vaccines remain one of the most prominent lines of defense against the coronavirus pandemic to date. 
Especially with the emergence of new corona variants that could boost demand for vaccines for a long time to come. 
My purpose is to choose shares of a vaccine company, specifically shares of the American multinational pharmaceutical company - Pfizer (PFE), to learn about the fluctuation trend of a company's shares. 
How to provide vaccines in the midst of a pandemic, thereby testing whether Pfizer is a worthy choice for investors at this time.

# Models applied and reasons for selection
The reason this model was chosen to serve the valuation of PFE shares is because although it is not a perfect theory or tool for comprehensive valuation, the "spirit" of CAPM is correct. It provides a useful measure that helps investors determine the return they deserve from an investment, in return for putting their money at adequate risk. The Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM) describes the relationship between systematic risk and expected returns for assets, especially stocks. Therefore, with the available data set collected from the Yahoo Finance site, it completely matches the model's evaluation criteria, creating convenience for the process of better stock valuation.

# Variables used:
The model is based on the relationship between the asset's beta coefficient (specifically the PFE stock), the risk-free interest rate (specifically the 10-year US Treasury bill rate), and the risk premium of stocks and markets.
CAPM formula
R = Rf + β*(Rm - Rf
In there:
R: Expected return on a security.
Rf: (Risk-free rate) risk-free interest rate.
β: measures a stock's sensitivity to market fluctuations.
Rm: (Required market return) expected return of the market.
Rm- Rf: (Risk premium) Equity market premium.
